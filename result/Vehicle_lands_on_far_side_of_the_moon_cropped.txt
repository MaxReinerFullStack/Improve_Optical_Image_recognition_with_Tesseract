BEUING —— China reached a
milestone in space exploration
on Thursday, landing a vehicle
on the far side of the moon for
the ﬁrst time in history, China's
state media announced.

The landing of the probe,
called Chang‘e-4 after the moon

‘ goddess in Chinese mythology,

l is one in a coming series of ms- 3
sions that underscore the coun- j
try‘s ambitions to join — and

i even lead —— the space race.

l China landed another rover
on the moon in 2013, joining the
United States and the Soviet
Union as the only nations to
have carried out a “soft landing”
there, but the Chang'e‘4 is the
ﬁrst to touch down on the side of
the moon that perpetually faces
away from the Earth.

"This space mission shows

3 that China has reached the

advanced world-class level in
deep space exploration,” said
Zhu Menghua, a professor at the
Macau University of Science
and Technology who has
worked closely with China’s
space administration. “We
Chinese people have done
something that the Americans
have not dared try."

Although a latecomer by

. decades to space exploration,
China is quickly catching up,

experts say, and could challenge
the United States for supremacy
in artiﬁcial intelligence, Quan-

tum computing and other ﬁelds.

China plans to begin fully
operating its third space station
by 2022. to put astronauts in a
lunar base by later in that de-
cade. and to send probes to
Mars, including ones that could
return samples of the Martian
surface back to Earth,
